 * The earliest possible entrypoint, injected with a class initialization block

 * use this entrypoint rather than GFH's to ensure that any transformations
 * you make are actually loaded by Mixon.<br>
 * Do NOT directly reference any game or other mod classes from this entrypoint.<br>
 * All Throwables propagated from here will be displayed as a critical mod loading error.
